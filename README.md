This Project is a Spigot Lobby-Plugin that should provide 
the user as many Features as possible and as much configuration options.
Because we don't have time to create new features or to fix unnessecary
bugs.

**Latest Changes:**
- Added new Command Handling
- Beautified and Cleaned Configuration Files
- Updated Player Initialization (Shields deactivated by default)

The repo is cloned to GitHub and originally hosted on GitLab.
